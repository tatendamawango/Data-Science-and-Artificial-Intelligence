# Mathematical Methods of Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains projects completed as part of the Mathematical Methods of AI course. It explores foundational and practical methods across four major areas of AI, with a focus on analysis, robustness, and interpretability.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- `XAI/`: Explainable AI experiments with Decision Trees and Random Forests using LIME and feature importance.
- `Recommender Systems/`: Implementation and evaluation of collaborative filtering models (KNN, SVD, Baseline) on Amazon Electronics data.
- `Probabilistic Robotics/`: Implementation of Extended Kalman Filters (EKF) for state estimation using GPS data.
- `LDA/`: Topic modeling on fake and real news datasets using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
